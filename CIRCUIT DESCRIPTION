CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION


Our circuit starts with the DTMF Decoder IC with the mobile phone connected to it,
the other mobile phone wirelessly connects the phone connected to the IC through the phone call and
then delivers some dial code according to our requirement for switching on/off appliances.

Then the output from the Decoder IC (q1, q2, q3, q4 - these outputs depends upon the input that is received from mobile phone) 
goes to the Inverter IC 74LS04 which acts as a buffer for the output of DTMF IC.

Then the four outputs from the Inverter IC go to the Digital Input Pins of the Arduino Uno.

Arduino Uno is the brain of our Project and all the coding that runs our project is burned in the Arduino Uno.

Then according to our code, Five Digital outputs from Arduino Uno go to the various devices which are to be operated
through the mobile phone.

Here we are using 3 LEDs as Digital outputs which are operating on 5V,
One AC source and one 36V DC source.

Operations of devices

1.LED 1, 2, 3 

Directly through Digital output pins of Arduino (5V)

2.AC Sources and DC Sources
 First outputs from Digital Output pins of Arduino goes to the MOTOR DRIVER IC which is used to amplify 5V to 9V.
Then the output from the MOTOR DRIVER IC goes to Relays which are used as switching devices.
