# Wireless Home Automation

**What this project is about ?**

Home automation covers all the aspects of centralized control of lighting, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), 
home appliances, security locks of windows and doors.  Wireless home automation provides better facilities and increased quality 
of life for the elderly and disabled who might otherwise require specialised care and be left to fend off for themselves. 
With the use of this mobile controlled home automation using Arduino, you can perform switching operation of any load or device 
which is connected with the given circuit. Suppose you are away from home or office and you forget to switch off any load like tube 
light, fan or air conditioner. Now one way is that to switch it off you have to go all the way back wasting your fuel and your time
to turn it off. But if you have installed this wireless home automation system in your office or home, you can switch off that device 
right from your current location. 

**Key Aspects of this Project are :**

**1.** C/C++ Programming in Arduino IDE

**2.** Arduino Uno

**3.** DTMF Decoder

**4.** Integrated Electronics
